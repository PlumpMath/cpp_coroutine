Note:

This is my implementation of the cpp coroutine.

For coroutine, pls refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine).

Actually, when I study the google's go program language(golang).

I find the goroutine(golang's coroutine) and channel are very elegance program concept.

So, I want to implement them in cpp :).

Currently, it's just a toy code,and it's very interesing, 

but it's not very easy to undertand as the normal code,as they can jump between the function stack.

I use the classic producer-consumer as an example to verify my implementation.

Build:

1) Make

Usage:

1) ./main
